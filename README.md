# mobileIDE
Not inaccurately named

Although not just for your mobile phones.
This project is designed to be a portable (mobile) IDE, it was just named "mobileIDE" by the project manager :)
The project aims to be _lightweight_, _accessible_ and **_compatible_** with almost all devices.

The project has many hopes and aspirations, but we will have to wait and see if this even gets off the ground....
